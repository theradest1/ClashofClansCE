VERY MUCH A WORK IN PROGRESS - look at notes and known bugs if you get confused about anything

To Run:
1. send CECLASH.8xp to your calc
2. If you want a pre-made map send EXMAP.8xv to your calc
3. run CECLASH.8xp

Controlls:
exit (both game and select menu): graph
move: number-pad (excluding 5)
select: 5
spawn troop: sto->
place objects:
   fence: y=
   bomb: window
   empty: zoom
   cannon: 2nd
   archer tower: mode

Source:
1. go into 'Source' folder
2. send CECALPHA.8xp to your calc
3. edit/compile 'CECALPHA'
4. we don't talk about the code

Known bugs (+ fixes):
- troop just going to random places: do a RAM reset
- the correct object isn't placed: just try again until it works
- post any others here: https://www.cemetech.net/forum/viewtopic.php?t=18605

Notes (actually kinda important because of confusion):
- sorry for bad keybinding, will be fixing in the future
- ignore the troop movement when no defences to be found, still working on that (this includes phasing through walls
- bombs don't do anything yet
- the select menu doesn't have a whole lot
- there currently isn't a way to get rid of troops, so just exit and start the program again
